Hello! I am a programmer with an interest in Information Security. I am current doing some projects on Web Development, specifically on the Back End side of things.
Although I have several other projects that are not associated with this account, I believe they lack a certain charm, unlike the projects I have right here.
In other words, I am quite proud of the projects I have below.

I prefer to not include my personal details on this account publicly as I believe there should be work-life boundaries.

Send an email to `schwarzer.vulpecula@gmail.com` if you have any questions.
